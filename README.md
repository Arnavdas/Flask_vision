# Flask_vision

To see how this project works watch this : https://youtu.be/rLS70BZgzYU

Served MASK_RCNN, YOLO, KEYPOINY_RCNN models in Flask

for YOLO, followed this tutorial (uses opencv) : https://opencv-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yolo/yolo.html

for MASK_RCNN & KEYPOINT_RCNN, followed this tutorial (uses detectron2) : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16jcaJoc6bCFAQ96jDe2HwtXj7BMD_-m5

for the 2 RCNNs above you will need GPU, but also you can do it via cpu(i did that way), install cpu specific packages here : https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/install.html 

for flask I refered many resources but particularly these were helpfull : https://roytuts.com/upload-and-display-image-using-python-flask/ , https://www.javatpoint.com/flask-tutorial,
